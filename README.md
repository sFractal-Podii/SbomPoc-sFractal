# SbomPoc
Webserver with status of SBOM Poc

## Setup guide
First ensure you have the following set up in your computer
- elixir 1.10.4
- nodejs > 12 LTS
- Postgresql > 11

You can use [the phoenix installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#content) to ensure you
have everything set up as expected

## Installing SBOM utilities
You will need to install the following dependancies to enable production of SBOM files from the command line

```shell
npm install -g @cyclonedx/bom
```

### Password for accessing the sbom dashboard
```shell
username: sbom
password: sbom
```

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Convenience make tasks
This project includes a couple of convenience `make` tasks. To get the full list
of the tasks run the command `make targets` to see a list of current tasks. For example

```shell

sbom                   Create SBOM file for hex and npm deps
```

## Generating SBOM file

## Deployment to GCP

Instructions to deployment can be found on [deployment docs](./docs/deployment.md)


## Adding status
You can add your project status as markdown content by adding a markdown file to the `/status` directory.

Your markdown file needs to have an author and the body.

```markdown
%{
  author: "Your company name or your name"
}

---

The body of your content
```

### The author
This is at the top of the file and can look like this:

```markdown
%{
  author: "Your company name or your name"
}
```
### The body

The body comes immediatly after the author declaration and is marked by three dashes `---`

```markdown
---

The body of your content
```
